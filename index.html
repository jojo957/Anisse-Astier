            <h2>Mass delete of Gmail emails</h2>
            <h3>Using Google Apps Script to clear your old emails</h3>
            </a>
            <p>Gmail used to be the reference for "infinite email storage". Not anymore. The space growth stopped, and then Google started selling storage space. It wouldn't be an issue if it were easy to mass delete emails; unfortunately batch delete operations can be quite long, and even lock you out of …</p>

            <h3>It should have been a tweet, but instead you get a short essay</h3>
            </a>
            <p>This has been brewing for a while, but I finally put it into words during this pandemic: if you're an embedded software engineer, the ability to work remotely (without the hardware next to you) is in fact a sign that you have reached a certain level of software engineering maturity …</p>

            </a>
            <p>I noticed recently how little I knew about IPv6. For someone working on broadband gateways, that's not something I'm most proud of. But I've learned a little in the past few months, and I thought I'd share it here.</p>

            <p>In an ideal world, one could pick the programming language of their choice and always generate the optimal machine code. But we live in the real world, and it isn't …</p>
